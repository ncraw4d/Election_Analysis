# Overview of Election Audit
The purpose of this election audit analysis was to determine how many candidates there were, how many votes each candidate received, and who won the election. The analysis also showed how many counties voters resided in and what county had the largest percentage of votes cast.

### Election-Audit Summary
Dear Committee Members of the Election Commission,

This election audit script could be used in any election. The script can be modified to add more candidates and counties from a larger election. It can also reduce the number of candidates and counties if this was necessary.  This script could be used for school board elections as instead of running the script for counties it could be run using school district names along with the board member names. Or the script could be used to find the winner in a local race that is located in one county. Instead of county names, the zip codes of the represented areas could be used to see the breakdown of voter turn out and who won the election. As you can see this script can be useful to your committee for elections that occur in the future.

Sincerely,

Nancy Crawford
